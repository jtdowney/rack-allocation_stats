Rack AllocationStats help

Append ras[trace]=true to your URL to trace all object allocations during the
request. The server will respond with statistics on the allocations, instead of
the application's response.

Options

ras[times]=COUNT
    send the request to the application COUNT times, to reduce statistics from
    initial allocations that don't happen on repeat requests.

ras[help]
    immediately respond with this help text

ras[scope]=SCOPE
    limit the list of allocations in the response to those whose `sourcefile`
    matches SCOPE. ras[scope]='.' is a special case which is expanded to be
    the current working directory.
